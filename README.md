# Projects2
These are some of the projects I completed while I was a student of Business Analytics at Imperial College London
- For HMA Individual CW, I examinined the prevalence of Low Birth Weight among Infants Born to Black Mothers using analytical methods. I achieved this by employing a logistic regression analysis to examine the influence of socio-economic and environmental factors. By analysing the intersection of race, income inequality, education, and physical health, this research contributes to the understanding of the complex factors impacting low birth weight and birth outcomes.
- For LSC.RMD, I predicted lettuce demand in four different stores of a restaurant using time series forecasting.
- For RMA Individual project part 1 & 2, I  explored sales forecasting and attitudinal metrics analysis for effective marketing using a fictional dataset. With data-driven decision making becoming increasingly important for businesses to succeed in a competitive market, forecasting sales with models such as multiple linear regression and ARIMA can provide valuable information to help companies plan for growth. Analysing attitudinal metrics can also help businesses understand the effectiveness of their advertising and promotional campaigns in winning over customers. By using these metrics, businesses can make informed decisions on how to allocate resources efficiently and effectively to maximize their brand's success.
